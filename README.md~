    Numbers, Operators and Expressions:
    [x]  What's the difference between an Integer and a Float?
	R -  Integers are... Integers? 1,2,3,4,5,6,7... and float is 2.23224, 2323.23232, 34552.23...
    [x]  Why should you be careful when converting back and forth between integers and floats?
	R - When we have a float and convert him to an integer, we cut part of the number. So, 2.234.to_i == 2 (0.234 is missing :p)
    [x]  What's the difference between =, ==, and ===?
	R - = to assignment like A = 10. == to compare two values, like IF a == b. === will asks if the right thing is member or a part of the thing on the left. "Hello" === /ello/
    [x]  How do you do exponents in Ruby?
	R - use **. 2**2 == 2^2 on math
    [x]  What is a range?
	R - Range is a gap of two numbers, like (0..5) is the range of 0 to 5
    [x]  How do you create a range?
	R - (start_interval..end_interval). (a...b) will exclude b range of a to b-1
    [x]  What's the difference between (1..3) and (1...3)?
	R - answer is above. 1...3 will exclude 3 of the range
    [x]  What are three ways to create a range?
	R - i don't know if are these three ways, but i know 1..3, 1...3, Range.new(1,3)

    Strings:
    [x]  What's the difference between single and double quotes?
	R - double quotes allow to make string interpolation "#{my_var}" and scape caracteres like single quotes
    [x]  What is string interpolation?
	R - String interpolation is the way to add a variable value at your string, answer above.
    [x]  What are escape characters?
	R- are especial caracters that can make a a different thing on your string, like \n that make a new line, or \t to add a tab.
    [x]  What are line breaks?
	R- line breaks are "enters", but on strings you add \n to do this.
    [x]  How do you make other things into strings?
	R - calling some methods that this class allow.
    [x]  How do you concatenate strings?
	R - string.concat(another_string), "alow" << "test", "my str" + "another str"
    [x]  How do you access a specific character or substring?
	R - string[index]
    [x]  How do you split up strings into arrays?
	R - sintr.split('')
